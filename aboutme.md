title: About me
---

I am a fifth year PhD student in the department of statistics at Penn State University. My research focuses on Bayesian modeling, specifically in the modeling of hard-to-reach popualtions like female sex workers and drug users. If I'm not coding something in R, I'm probably on my bike or playing video games that came out before I was 5 years old.
